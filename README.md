CDC: Implement the CDC mechanism in your database. This can be done using tools like Debezium, which captures and streams database changes to Apache Kafka or another message broker.

Message Broker: Use a message broker, such as Apache Kafka, to receive and store the change events emitted by the CDC tool. Kafka provides a reliable and scalable platform for streaming data.

Streaming Pipeline: Set up a streaming pipeline using a tool like Apache Kafka Streams, Apache Flink, or Apache Spark Streaming. This pipeline consumes the change events from Kafka, performs any necessary transformations or enrichments, and prepares the data for WebSocket communication.

WebSocket Server: Deploy a WebSocket server that acts as the endpoint for clients to establish WebSocket connections. This server should be responsible for handling WebSocket connection requests, managing the connections, and sending data to connected clients.

WebSocket Integration: In the streaming pipeline, integrate with the WebSocket server to send the processed data to connected WebSocket clients. This integration can involve sending data to the WebSocket server through a WebSocket library or a WebSocket client that communicates with the server.

By following this approach, you can bridge the gap between CDC and WebSocket, allowing clients to receive real-time updates over WebSocket connections based on the captured database changes. The streaming pipeline plays a vital role in processing and forwarding the data from the CDC source to the WebSocket server for distribution to connected clients.


Create topic
```{sh}
docker exec kafka kafka-topics.sh \
    --create \
    --topic cdc.MyEvents.dbo.EventData \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
    --partitions 1 \
    --replication-factor 1
```

Write debezium connector config
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @debezium-connector-config.properties http://localhost:8083/connectors

Check the connector is working
curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/connectors/sqlserver-connector/status


When testing, you can subscribe to the topic
docker exec kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
    --topic cdc.MyEvents.dbo.EventData \
    --from-beginning


and then make a change...



Useful kafka commands
kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic cdc
kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic cdc --from-beginning


## Usage considerations

**is it best practice to query the data from the database when the session begins, then connect to kafka for data changes or to use kafka to catchup?**

The approach to querying data from the database and connecting to Kafka for data changes depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of your application. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and the choice may vary based on factors such as the nature of your data, the volume of changes, the desired real-time behavior, and the overall system architecture.

Here are two common approaches:

**Querying Data at the Beginning**: In this approach, you can fetch the initial data from the database when a session begins. This ensures that you have the most up-to-date data available at the start. You can then subscribe to Kafka topics to receive real-time data changes or events and update the application's state accordingly. This approach is suitable when you require the latest data immediately and need to react to data changes in real-time. It may involve a combination of querying the database and consuming Kafka events.

**Using Kafka for Catching Up**: In this approach, you rely on Kafka as the source of truth for your data. Instead of querying the entire dataset from the database at the beginning, you consume the Kafka events from the beginning of the topic to catch up on past data changes. This way, you build the application's state based on the sequence of events. Once caught up, you continue to consume new events in real-time. This approach is useful when you have a large volume of data changes or events and want to avoid heavy database queries at the beginning. It also provides a centralized and scalable way to process data changes.

Considerations for choosing between these approaches:

Data Freshness: If your application requires immediate access to the latest data, querying the database at the beginning may be more suitable. However, if near real-time data is sufficient, using Kafka for catching up can provide an efficient and scalable solution.

Data Volume: If you have a large volume of data changes or events, relying on Kafka for catching up can be more efficient compared to querying the entire dataset from the database.

System Complexity: Using Kafka for catching up introduces additional complexity in managing event processing, ensuring data consistency, and handling possible event replay scenarios. Querying the data from the database simplifies the initial data retrieval process but may require additional effort for real-time event processing.

Ultimately, the choice depends on your specific use case and the trade-offs you are willing to make. You may also consider a hybrid approach where you combine elements of both strategies to achieve the desired balance between data freshness, scalability, and complexity.
